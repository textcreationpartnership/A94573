            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat whereas after a long Conteſt in this Poore Iſland againſt Tyranny and Injuſtice (wherein the treaſure of the Nation hath been exhauſted, and the precious Blood of many thouſands ſpilt, the Parliament being Neceſſitated to ſpend their Time for many Years in maintaining the War, and providing for the Defence of themſelves, and ſuch who Engaged with them in that quarrell) God hath been pleaſed (we hope in Mercy to the Nation) to bring You once again together in a time of Peace, to heal our Breaches, to Eſtabliſh firmly the Ancient Rights and Freedomes of <hi>England,</hi> which were the ſubject of this great quarrell (which God decided on our ſide) and to ſettle ſuch wayes of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing impartiall Juſtice, that the Name of God may be exalted in Righteouſneſs, and no man in the end have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the Blood and Treaſure expended in the purſuance of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Petitioners therefore humbly crave leave to preſent to Your Honours their ſenfe of ſome of the principall things wherein that Tyranny conſiſted, againſt which we did then in Judgement and Conſcience Engage, which were</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The late Kings Uſurpation over Parliaments, Committing and keeping diverſe of their Members in Priſon, as long as he thought good, without bringing them to tryall; In preventing their Meeting, and Diſſolving them when they were met, at Pleaſure: His Deniall and oppoſition of their Supream Truſt, to provide in all things for the ſafety and welfare of the People, under pretence of a Negative Voice.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Challenging of ſuch an Intereſt in the Militia, as to Command the ſame at his Pleaſure, without the Parliament, and to place the Subordinate Commands of the ſame in whom he pleaſed: whereby he claimed a Power to enforce O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to any of his illegall commands, both in matters Religious and Civill; which directly tended to the razing out the very Name and Beeing of Parliaments, which have been the Ancient Preſervers of the Nations Freedome.</p>
            <p n="3">III. His Introducing and exerciſing of an Arbitrary Power by his Councel and others, over mens Perſons and Eſtates, when they ought to have been tryed by the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. His aſſuming a Right (under pretence of Neceſſity for the Nations good, and to ſecure it from future Attempts, whereof he onely would be Judge) to Leavy Money upon the People without their Conſent in Parliament; wherein (as in the Particulars aforeſaid) he pretended he was unaccountable for what he did, either to the Parliament, or any earthly Power whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And your Petitioners do humbly crave leave to minde your Honours of the many Signal Teſtimonies, which God hath given of his diſpleaſure againſt all who have endeavoured to ſupport the aforeſaid Tyranny, or have eſpouſed it as their quarrell, under any notion whatſoever: And of the price now put into your hands to ſecure the Nation, from fu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure attempts and dangers of the like Nature: And not onely the Armies Declarations, and the Agreement of the People, propoſed by them (remaining upon Record in your Houſe) but the Ruines and Spoils of the Land, and of the many thouſand families there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: The expence of many Millions of Treaſure, the wounds and ſcars, and loſt members of very many, and (above all) the precious blood of ſuch, who were ſlain in the quarrell, together with the long waiting, earneſt and patient expectation of many good people (retaining in their hearts affection to the good old Cauſe) cry aloud to you to call upon God with us for Wiſdome, that you may be taught, and enabled to eſtabliſh ſuch a ſure foundation of Right, Freedome and Juſtice, that the People of the Nation may not be put again upon ſuch hazards of their Lives, and expence of their Eſtates for the deſence of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore Your Petitioners Humbly pray,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That together with the conſtant ſucceſſion of Free Parliaments duely Choſen, the Supreme Power and Truſt, which the People (the Original of all juſt Power) commit unto them, to make Laws, Conſtitutions and Offices for the Government of the whole, and to call all Officers of Juſtice, and Miniſters of State whatſoever to accompt, may be ſo clearly Declared and Secured againſt all attempts to the contrary, that no queſtion may henceforth ariſe concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>That the Militia may be ſettled with ſuch Wiſdome and full Security, that it may not be in the power of any to make uſe thereof againſt the People, or their Succeſſive Parliaments either to deſtroy their Beeing, or their Freedome.</p>
            <p>That no Money may be Leavied upon the People (on any pretence whatſoever) but by their common Conſent in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>That our Civil Wars being long ſince ended, the Peoples Perſons and Eſtates may be onely ſubject to be diſpoſed of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Land; and that henceforth none may be reputed Offenders, or proceeded againſt by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or otherwiſe, but ſuch who ſhall be really found tranſgreſſors of the Law: And that there may be ſpeedy conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had of the long Impriſonment of many Perſons well-affected (and ſome in remote places) without any due proſecution: And we the rather preſſe this, becauſe it hath been the practiſe of former Parliaments, and in particular of the late Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Long-Parliament, to take notice of, and redreſſe the grievances of the People, to relieve thoſe who were illegally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and to reſtore them to the enjoyment of Liberty, their common Birth-right by the Law of the Land; which the Lord hath ſignally owned, and bleſt from Heaven, and the good People have abundantly rejoyced in.</p>
            <p>That ſo long as it ſhall be judged Neceſſary to keep up an Army for the preſervation of the People from the attempts of the common Enemy, Domeſtick or Foraign, the Officers and Souldiers who have hazarded their Lives for the Nations Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, may not be turned out-of their reſpective imployments without a legall Triall at a Court-Martiall, that ſo the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Power may be preſerved in the hands of ſuch, who are not meerly Mercenary, Newters, or disaffected.</p>
            <p>And that as the ſafety of our Religion is concerned in the Defence of our Civil Rights, ſo ſuch proviſion may now be made for the encouragement of the ſincere Profeſſours of the ſame; that no tender Conſcience may be oppreſſed. And in doing theſe things you will be glorious Inſtruments in the hand of God, and Honourable in your Country, And the Lives and Eſtates of your Petitioners ſhall be freely expoſed to hazzard in your juſt Defence.</p>
